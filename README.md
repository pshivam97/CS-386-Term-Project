## Motivation 

Over the last few decades, research on handwriting recognition has made impressive progress. The research and development on handwritten word recognition are to a large degree motivated by many application areas, such as automated postal address, data acquisition in banks, text-voice conversion, security, etc. As the prices of scanners, computers and handwriting-input devices are falling steadily, we have seen an increased demand for handwriting recognition systems and software packages. Few commercial handwriting recognition systems are now available in the market. Current commercial systems have an impressive performance in recognizing machine-printed characters and neatly written texts. For instance, Xerox in the U.S. has developed TextBridge for converting hardcopy documents into electronic document files. Notwithstanding the impressive progress, there is still a significant performance gap between the human and the machine in recognizing off-line unconstrained hand- written words. The difficulties encountered in recognizing unconstrained handwritings are mainly caused by huge variations in writing styles and the overlapping and the interconnection of neighboring characters. Furthermore, many applications demand very high recognition accuracy and reliability. Sadly, in the banking sector, although ATMs and networked banking systems being widely available, many transactions are still carried out in the form of cheques. Googleâ€™s Tesseract, despite being developed by the greatest IT beast, its output will have very poor quality if the input images are not preprocessed to suit it. This motivates us to research and develop a handwritten sentence recognizer with much improved accuracy.
